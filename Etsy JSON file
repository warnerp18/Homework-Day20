        "description": "PLEASE NOTE: THIS LISTING IS FOR ONE STOCKING ONLY.\r\n\r\nMy personalized hand-knit stockings will surely become a treasured heirloom in your family. I knit these with a premium 100% acrylic yarn with approximately 9 different colors in each stocking. I like to have fun and add variety by drawing inspiration from traditional Fair Isle patterns, but like to mix it up for a new, perhaps, non-traditional look. I add a pointed cuff and sew a hand-knitted I-cord trim around its edge. Then, for the finishing touch, I knit a sturdy loop for hanging and add 6 vintage brass jingle bells for a festive flare!\r\n\r\nThe stocking measures approximately 20&quot; long from top of cuff to tip of toe and 12&quot; circumference.\r\n\r\nNot only are these great for Christmas, but they make a wonderful gift for bridal showers, weddings or baby showers. So go ahead, start your own family tradition with a Christmas stocking from cherylKNITS.\r\n\r\nWhen ordering, specify photo number 2, 3, or 4.\r\nLet me know what name you would like me to hand- embroider on your stocking, and I will have it completed in 7-10 days.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: THIS LISTING IS FOR ONE STOCKING ONLY.",

PHOTOS FOR INVITATIONS\r\nIf your invitation design comes with a photo, please send a high-resolution format straight from your camera with NO CROPPING OR REDUCTION in size for proper print quality. I work with {{huge}} high resolution files that require large photos. Small photos will blur when enlarging to fit the template and print blurry as well. If the photo is not submitted at time of purchase it will be included in your free revision after the jpeg file has been emailed to you.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS FOR HORIZONTAL PHOTO INVITES\r\n(where photo covers entire background of card)\r\n\u2022 Please make sure your child is positioned to the far left or right of the photo as there needs to be space on the opposite side of him\/her to go under the framing that holds the party info. I will crop the photo for you. Requires a 300dpi or higher resolution. \r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS ALL OTHER INVITES WITH PHOTOS\r\n\u2022 Please make sure your child is as close to the center of the photo as possible as there needs to be space off to the left of him\/her to go under the Mickey\/Minnie heads that hold the party info. I will crop the photo for you. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Please don&#39;t send in a close-up shot of your child as they tend to consume at least half of of the invitation just to show the face and there needs to be space off to the left of him\/her to go under the Mickey\/Minnie heads that hold the party info. If you mention in your order notes that you&#39;d like for me to zoom in on the photo, I will gladly crop the photo for you. \r\n\r\n\u2022 If sending in a photo where your child is holding balloons or stuffed animals\/characters, please ensure that the plushies are on, or right next to, your child so they&#39;ll show on the invitation in the limited space provided. I will crop the photo for you. \r\n\r\nYou can email your photo to MyPartyPrintables @gmail.com or attach it in the Etsy email system by clicking the blue link that reads &#39;Attach Image&#39; when sending a message. Unfortunately, you won&#39;t be able to attach it in the shopping cart.\r\n\r\n\u25ba 4. I WILL SEND YOU THE FINAL WITHIN 24 BUSINESS HOURS AFTER ORDER PLACEMENT but usually within a few hours after I&#39;ve received ALL customization (UNLESS the store is experiencing a high volume of orders, it&#39;s the weekend or holiday - store is closed on Sunday. \r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 By purchasing you are agreeing to my shop POLICIES and STORE HOURS https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/MyCelebrationShoppe\/policy?ref=shopinfo_policies_leftnav and stating that you have read this listing description FULLY \u2605\u2605\u2605 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u25ba MAKE SURE YOU ORDER THE RIGHT SIZE & DESIGN \u25c4\r\nKeep in mind that if you are having your invitation printed at a photo lab, it&#39;s much cheaper to print the 4x6 size. I recommend checking out printing policies and pricing prior to ordering. If the size of your invitation is not specified in your order notes at the time of purchase, a 5x7 will be sent to you. No exception.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If you purchase the wrong DESIGN (or have changed your mind on the design) ordered AFTER the digital file of the invitation has been sent to your email box, you will need to re-purchase another invitation as I&#39;ll need to start from scratch and work with a completely different template. No exception. See my policy page for more policies: http:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/MyCelebrationShoppe\/policy?ref=shopinfo_policies_leftnav\r\n\r\nBecause this store is so incredibly busy with messages and orders on a daily basis, I will not be able to provide samples or confirmation that I&#39;ve received your photo needed for your invitation. If for some reason I didn&#39;t receive your photo successfully (after I&#39;ve checked Etsy messages, gmail (inbox, spam\/junk folders), I will request that you resend it when emailing you the proof.\r\n\r\nPHOTO EDITING - I do NOT offer photo editing services (blurring or creating white background behind child, red-eye, etc) so please be sure and submit a photo you&#39;re happy with. I *DO* brighten, lighten and turn photos into B&W. Be sure and request that you&#39;d like the photo to be black and white. Otherwise, it will appear in color.\r\n\r\n\u25ba REVISIONS ARE ALLOWED UP TO 14 DAYS AFTER ORDER PLACEMENT \u25c4\r\nDue to the high volume of orders this store gets, coupled with the {{huge}} high resolution files I work with, all files will be automatically archived from my computer 14 days after order placement. So please be sure and review the document(s) sent to you right away in case any changes need to be made. Otherwise, you&#39;ll need to re-purchase the items. No exception.\r\n\r\nONE FREE ROUND OF REVISIONS is included with your order when viewing the proof. This includes minor text edits and\/or adding another photo if the first one doesn&#39;t work as well as you thought it would. If you require ADDITIONAL revisions, there is a $5.00 fee per round of edits. (Changing the design template, size, or changing the wording to accommodate a 2nd party date\/time are NOT considered a revision.) Please purchase this listing for additional edits: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/119436894\/need-a-few-more-revisions?ga_search_query=revisions\r\n\r\n\u25baWHEN ORDERING\u25c4\r\nIf you do not provide all of the information needed for the invitation, including photo, at time of purchase, your invitation will be emailed back to you with a &#39;proof&#39; watermark where you can then use your one free round of revisions to complete your order.\r\n\r\nIf a specific design # is not provided in your order notes during checkout, the design shown in the first photo of the listing you made your purchase from will be sent to you to complete your order. No exception. It&#39;s the buyer&#39;s responsibility to provide ALL information at time of purchase.\r\n\r\n\u25ba SPECIAL REQUESTS \u25c4\r\nSpecial requests to existing listings in the store MUST be made PRIOR to purchase as not all requests can be granted. Special requests made at time of, or after, purchase (in order notes or messages) unfortunately will NOT be granted.\r\n\r\n*************************************************************************\r\n\u25ba MICKEY MOUSE PARTY PRINTABLE MUST HAVES\r\nhttp:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/MyCelebrationShoppe?section_id=12811780\r\n\r\n\u25ba MINNIE MOUSE PARTY PRINTABLE MUST HAVES\r\nhttp:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/MyCelebrationShoppe?section_id=12811776\r\n\r\n\u25ba MICKEY & MINNIE MOUSE PARTY PRINTABLES FOR TWINS & SIBLINGS\r\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/MyCelebrationShoppe?section_id=13121784\r\n\r\n*************************************************************************\r\n\r\n\u25ba WHERE TO FIND ENVELOPES \u25c4 \r\nYou can find envelopes at Office Max, Staples, Walmart, etc. Stationary stores have the colorful packs of envelopes I&#39;ve noticed. You can also google &#39;4x6 envelope&#39;, for instance, and a plethora of choices will appear and some websites offer free shipping.\r\nEnvelopes for 4x6 Size - Called A-6 4.75&quot; x 6.5&quot;\r\nEnvelopes for 5x7 Size - Called A-7 5.25&quot; x 7.25&quot;\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25ba PRINTING WITH ONLINE OR WALK-IN PRINTING VENDORS \u25c4\r\nKeep in mind that My Celebration Shoppe ONLY creates the files to have printed and is not responsible for the printing aspect of the files. That is solely the responsibility of the buyer. Once printed, If any of the files look different in anyway from how the files emailed to you &#39;view&#39;, that&#39;s a technical issue with your printing vendor -NOT- the file sent to you. (ie: The file views crisply but prints blurry or pixelated.) A listing is provided on my Policies page of where you can print your party printables.\r\n\r\nNOTE: If you have a lab print them, you may need to ask them to print your order without the &quot;auto correct&quot; so the colors print appropriately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25ba PRINTING TIPS IF PRINTING FROM HOME \u25c4\r\nPlease keep in mind that My Celebration Shoppe is ONLY responsible for creating the files to have printed and is not responsible for the printing aspect of the files. That is solely the responsibility of the buyer and are expected to have basic printing knowledge. \r\n\r\nYour files will print &#39;exactly&#39; as they &#39;view&#39;. If they look different in any way once printed, that&#39;s a technical issue with your printer\/printer settings NOT the files sent to you as JPG and PDF files can&#39;t physically alter in any way. For example, if the files &#39;view&#39; crisply but &#39;PRINT&#39; blurry, that means that files were saved incorrectly and you&#39;re printing a lower resolution than provided. If a portion of the file is printing, that&#39;s an indication that you&#39;ll need to select &#39;Fit To Page&#39; in your printer settings so that it&#39;ll print the entire page. If the files are printing in slightly different colors, you might check the ink cartridges to see if they need replacement or adjust the intensity settings on your printer. Generally, these solutions always solve these common problems!\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25ba MATERIALS YOU WILL NEED IF PRINTING FROM HOME \u25c4 \r\n\u2022 Printer\r\n\u2022 Scissors or paper cutter\r\n\u2022 Heavy weight premium photo paper in a soft\/semi gloss for photo invites or bright white matte finish card stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u25ba COLOR VARIATIONS \u25c4\r\nColors may vary from one computer monitor to another, quality of printer used as well as the many different types or brands of paper and ink your&#39;re printing with. My Celebration Shoppe is not responsible for the resulting color variations due to the many variables involved. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\r\nTHE FINE PRINT: \r\nPlease note all items are for PERSONAL USE ONLY.
